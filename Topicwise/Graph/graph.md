# When to Use Graphs

## On Matrices
Graphs can be used to represent matrices for tasks that involve connectivity, traversal, or mapping relationships between cells or elements.

# When to Use BFS

1. **Simultaneous Neighbor Traversal:**
   - BFS is ideal when approaching neighboring nodes simultaneously (e.g., problems like rotten oranges where multiple nodes spread an effect).
2. **Level-Order Traversal:**
   - Use BFS for tasks where a level-wise exploration of nodes is required.
3. **Non-Simultaneous Operations:**
   - BFS can also be used when counting simultaneous operations is not necessary.

# When to Use DFS

1. **Non-Simultaneous Operations:**
   - DFS is suitable when we do not need to count simultaneous operations.
2. **Depth-Based Traversal:**
   - Use DFS when you need to explore paths or traverse as deeply as possible before backtracking.
